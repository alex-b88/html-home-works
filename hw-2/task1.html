    <p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists" target="_blank">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie" target="_blank">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland" target="_blank">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Boys_(Peter_Pan)" target="_blank">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy" target="_blank">fairies</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy" target="_blank">pirates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid" target="_blank">mermaids</a>, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.</p>
    <p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism" target="_blank">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird" target="_blank"><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens" target="_blank"><i>Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</i></a> in 1906), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre" target="_blank">West End stage</a> play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy" target="_blank"><i>Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a> (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy" target="_blank"><i>Peter and Wendy</i></a>), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>
    <p>Barrie commissioned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_statue" target="_blank">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frampton" target="_blank">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens" target="_blank">Kensington Gardens</a> on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-1" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Six other statues have been cast from the original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_commemorative_stamps_2000–2009" target="_blank">series of UK postage stamps</a> issued by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail" target="_blank">Royal Mail</a> on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-2" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird" target="_blank"><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens" target="_blank">Kensington Gardens</a>", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to Kensington Gardens in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_play" target="_blank">stage play</a> titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy" target="_blank"><i>Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre" target="_blank">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_and_Stoughton" target="_blank">Hodder and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens" target="_blank">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a>, with the addition of illustrations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham" target="_blank">Arthur Rackham</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel" target="_blank">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy" target="_blank">Peter and Wendy</a>.</p>
    <p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-5" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
